# Microservice application with continuous integration

**What is this repository?**
This is an open source project to build a continuous integration pipeline for building, testing and deploying a microservices application in a continuous integration environment.

**Notes**
This section describes some design principles and decisions.
 - Less is more
    _"This is actually easy as it has just started ;)"_
 - By now we assume you use **jhipster** to generate microservices application.
    _"The jhipster microservice application has to be packaged as docker containers and use docker-compose for CI environment deployment."_
 - It uses **Gitlab** as code repository, CI and docker registry.
    _"Gitlab provides both on premises community version and a cloud service for free with unlimited repositories"_ 

**Notes for the future**
 - Other microservices application technology stacks will be added to this project in the future.
    _"The technology stack has to be generated using yeoman scaffolding, so you can have a working microservices application with a CI pipeline in minutes."_    
 
**Quick Start**
