**What is this repository?**
This is an open source project to build a continuous integration pipeline for building, testing and deploying a **jhipster** microservices application in a continuous integration environment.

**Notes**
This section describes some design principles and decisions.
 - Less is more
    _"This is actually easy as it has just started ;)"_
 - The jhipster application has to be packaged as docker containers.
 - It uses Gitlab as code repository, CI and docker registry.
    _"It provides both an on premises community version and a cloud service for free with unlimited repositories"_ 

**Quick Start**
TBD
